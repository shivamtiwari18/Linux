I am user of the programming function

------------------------------------------------
Installing OS prerequistiive:
1. RAM
2. CPU
3. Hardisk

4 PLATFORMS
1. Bare-Metal : Installing on Hardware
2. Virtualization : Install OS on top of other OS (Handy and Simple)
3. Dual-Booting : Single HArdware 2 OS
4. Cloud Computing : virtualization / Container (Docker)

Virtualization:
Install 1 program on top of other - HyperV (Microsoft)  , Zen, Virtual Box

Installing
Bios - Enable Virtualization
Virtual Hardware - Created as per requirement - RAM, CPU, Hardware
To install OS - bootable DVD or OS Image (ISO File)

Root is admin of the OS.

Command Prompt - prompting the command to perform.
sleep n - hold commmand for n seconds

Closing the program with different commands and usage of each
----------------------------------------------------------------
Close the graphical program - Cltr(left)+C
Ctrl+C (Sigterm) - Terminate the program/command
Ctrl+Z (SigKill) - Donot terminate + Pause + Put in the background

firefox & - Startes the program and put the program in the background

jobs - The commands in the background

************microservices/cron-tab - schedule tasks

fg 1 - Bring the program with id 1 in the foreground

i/p : echo "date" 
o/p : date

i/p : "`date`"
o/p : print the date

echo -n "hello" : no new line
To type out escape sequence - echo -e "hello\thi"
\b => backspace : Removes the previous letter
Limitations: We cannot use \b when the word goes to next line so use -n also
Eg: echo -n -e "hello\b"

To get the command helper:
man date: Gives the manual of the command.

To get the file: getid
Scripting File: We write all the commands in that file and we run as per our convinience.

Which of the following is list of ip address:
192.168.0.1
192.168.12345
192.12389
1234567

Ans : All of the above are right.

Valid IP:
____.____.____.____ and each range in 0-255 -> Only a convention
In the memory the IP Adress is not stored in the form of dot but without dots So last one is also correct.
The computer stores in bit and as a complete number.
Formula: bc : Binary Calculator

Proof: Ip of Google : 172.217.167.196
Binary to Number -> 172*2^4 + 217*2^16 + 167*2^8 + 196*2^0 => 2899945412 will also show google.
If 'Firewall' has also blocked the IP then also we will be able to reach there.
Only work for Black Proxy but not for White Proxy (Because it blocks all).


ANSWER ) 

Yes, it is a valid IP address. Restricting ourselves to version 4 of the Internet Protocol (or IP), an IP address is "a 32-bit unsigned integer". 
Since 123456 expressed in binary is 11110001001000000, is quite evidently qualified to be an IP address. In the required 32-bit format, it would be:

00000000000000011110001001000000

Or, grouping these into 8 bits in a block:

00000000 00000001 11100010 01000000

Converting to decimal, we have these groups as:

0 1 226 64

That is, 123456 is the IP address 0.1.226.64.

Is this address usable? IANA has this to say:

"Addresses starting with "0." are sometimes used for broadcasts to directly connected devices. If you see addresses starting with a "0." 
in logs they are probably in use on your network, which might be as small as a computer connected to a home gateway."

In essence, security-conscious ISPs might block this IP address, but there's nothing stopping you from using it in a network that you control.
