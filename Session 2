I am user of the programming function

------------------------------------------------
Installing OS prerequistiive:
1. RAM
2. CPU
3. Hardisk

4 PLATFORMS
1. Bare-Metal : Installing on Hardware
2. Virtualization : Install OS on top of other OS (Handy and Simple)
3. Dual-Booting : Single HArdware 2 OS
4. Cloud Computing : virtualization / Container (Docker)

Virtualization:
Install 1 program on top of other - HyperV, Zen, Virtual Box

Installing
Bios - Enable Virtualization
Virtual Hardware - Created as per requirement - RAM, CPU, Hardware
To install OS - bootable DVD or OS Image (ISO File)

Root is admin of the OS.

Command Prompt - prompting the command to perform.
sleep n - hold commmand for n seconds

Closing the program with different commands and usage of each
----------------------------------------------------------------
Close the graphical program - Cltr(left)+C
Ctrl+C - Terminate the program/command
Ctrl+Z - Donot terminate + Pause + Put in the background
firefox & - Startes the program and put the program in the background

jobs - The commands in the background
fg 1 - Bring the program with id 1 in the foreground

i/p : echo "date" 
o/p : date

i/p : "`date`"
o/p : print the date

echo -n "hello" : no new line
To type out escape sequence - echo -e "hello\thi"
\b => backspace : Removes the previous letter
Limitations: We cannot use \b when the word goes to next line so use -n also
Eg: echo -n -e "hello\b"

To get the command helper:
man date: Gives the manual of the command.

To get the file: getid
Scripting File: We write all the commands in that file and we run as per our convinience.


--------------------------------------
TASK
--------------------------------------
date keen running even after. -> bash livedate

Which of the follwing is list of ip address:
192.168.0.1
192.168.12345
192.12389
1234567

Ans : All of the above are right.

Valid IP:
____.____.____.____ and each range in 0-255 -> Only a convention
In the memory the IP Adress is not stored in the form of dot but without dots So last one is also correct.
The computer stores in bit and as a complete number.
Formula: bc : Binary Calculator

Proof: Ip of Google : 172.217.167.196
Binary to Number -> 172*2^4 + 217*2^16 + 167*2^8 + 196*2^0 => 2899945412 will also show google.
If 'Firewall' has also blocked the IP then also we will be able to reach there.
Only work for Black Proxy but not for White Proxy (Because it blocks all).
